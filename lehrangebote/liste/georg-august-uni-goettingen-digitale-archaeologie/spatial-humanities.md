beschreibung: Spatial Humanities (i.e. the application of geoinformation systems in the humanities) has been firmly established as a research field for more than 30 years. The seminar aims to provide an insight into the full range of possibilities that GIS offers for the study of the past, addressing key questions such as what kinds of new knowledge can be developed through the use of GIS alone and how effective GIS can be for different kinds of research. The focus is on methods for analysing GIS databases, visualising the results and interpreting these visualisations. How do humanities, geographical, cartographic, informatics and statistical methods come together? How do the philological, historical and cultural sciences, the visual and artefact studies or the social sciences benefit from the use of computer-assisted methods of spatial analysis?
